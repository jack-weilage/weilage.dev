## Plans
This website is __*very*__ early in development, so many many items simply haven't been implemented.

- [x] Create basic homepage
- [ ] Upgrade homepage
    - [ ] Animate all elements smoothly
    - [ ] Add background mask
- [ ] Create blog
    - [ ] Add markdown parser
    - [ ] Actually create blog articles

## Development
This website is built with <a href="https://kit.svelte.dev">SvelteKit</a>, so a development server is built in.
<br><br>
Use:
- `pnpm dev` to start a development server at <a target="_blank" href="http://localhost:3000">localhost:3000</a>.
<!-- <br> -->
- `pnpm dev -- --host` to host the server on your network at <a target="_blank" href="about:blank">{LOCAL_IP}:3000</a>.
<!-- <br> -->
- `pnpm build && pnpm preview` to build and host a production version of the site.
